# Project Supernova
A Helium Balloon, to assess the Helium Network.

## Features
This project is a PCB which is capable of being the primary payload on a PCB aboard a statospheric helium balloon. The PCB intends to downlink 

* Onboard GPS for position tracking
* Atmospheric condition sensors (temperature/pressure/humidity) to generate downlink data
* Onboard PID-controlled heater and battery manangement
* Very low cost (<$100)

## Notes
* 3v3 regulated voltage. 9v unregulated battery voltage.
